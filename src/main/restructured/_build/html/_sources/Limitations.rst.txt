Addressing
--------------

Within Tigase, all pubsub component address MUST be domain-based address and not a JID style address. This was made to simplify communications structure. Tigase will automatically set component names to ``pubsub.domain``, however any messages send to ``pubsub@domain`` will result in a ``SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE`` error.

Pubsub nodes within Tigase can be found as a combination of JID and node where nodes will be identified akin to service discovery. For example, to address a friendly node, use the following structure:

.. code:: xml

   <iq to='pubsub.domain'>
     <query node='friendly node'/>
   </iq>
